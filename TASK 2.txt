My first preference in the Summer Project was Hexapod and then Ball Balancing bot but due to constraint of time for me I wasn't able to do task for Ball Balancing Bot , although I have submitted the task for Hexapod . I chose Hexapod over other projects as I thought that this particular project offered me more learning opportunity in terms of domain I have lesser knowledge about as well as curious to know about such as Inverse Kinematics , a topic which is quite versatile and useful in the domain of robotics . I have tried to learn the same to some extent I could on my own . Other Sub-Domain I was interested in was Embedded systems which I'm not much aware about but the implications are wide ranging . I also want to learn more about Mechanical Design .
